=======

Except where noted, all changes made by Daisuke Maki <dmaki@cpan.org>

1.04 - 01 Apr 2006
 - Add missing SimplePull.pm for testing (Reported by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)
 - Fix POD

1.03 - 01 Apr 2006
 - Fix the push crawler: it was spawning way too many http connections
   when a massive amount of URI is enqueue'd to the broker.
   (Reported by Yappo)

1.02 - 04 Feb 2006 
 - properly call 'prep_request' on the handler, not the broker session

1.01 - 26 Jan 2006 ("Bang My Head Against The Wall" Release)
 - Fix the next state that fake_error_response posts to.

1.00 - 12 Dec 2005
 - Xango::Job can accept simple scalars, not just URI objects
   (nudged by Tasuku Suenaga over some prime ribs)
 - Only run POD tests when disttest is specified
 - Cleanup

0.99_02 - 18 Oct 2005
 - Oops, Xango::Tutorial should have been Xango::Manual::Intro
 - Document Xango::Broker::Base constructor arguments
 - Fix initialization. First load from config file, then use arguments.
 - Silence Pod::Test::Coverage (but not quite done yet)

0.99_01 - 17 Oct 2005
 *** Backwards Incompatible Changes ***
 - Change structure drastically: Xango::Broker is now separated into
   Xango::Broker::Pull, Xango::Broker::Push.
 - States have changed -- beware!

 *** House Cleaning ***
 - 0.99 no longer resides on the same svn repository as 0.0x.

 - Handler component's alias no longer needs to be 'handler'. You may specify
   arbitrary names in the Xango::Broker constructor.
 - Broker components' alias no longer needs to be 'broker'. Same as above.
 - Add Xango::Manual::Intro
 - apply_policy is now called synchronously, not thought POE's FIFO
 - Allow toggling DEBUG switch from $ENV via $ENV{XANGO_DEBUG}
 - Add tests for push and pull crawlers

0.09 - 
 - Add a 'shutdown' state.

0.08 - 09 Jun 2005
 - Fix POE::Kernel->sig() usage.
 - Autoflush debug handle
 - Add DnsCacheArgsDeref config parameter, in case you need to pass
   non-reference parameter list to the cache constructor. I needed this
   to use Cache::FastMmap as the cache engine

0.07 - 22 May 2005
 - Doc tweaks.
 - Properly use DnsComponentClass
 - Properly use DNS_COMP_ALIAS
 - Fix Xango::Config::init()

0.06 - 20 May 2005
 - Build.PL tweaks

0.05 - 08 May 2005
 - Remove processors from distribution.
 - Doc tweaks.

0.04 - 24 Apr 2005

 - Add HttpComponentClass, HttpComponent, JobRetrievalDelay, ReloadConfig
   to config parameters
 - Add Log::Dispatch

0.03 - 24 Mar 2005
  - rename xago-broker to xango (no need, as Xango has been integrated
    into one process, rather than multiple)
  - remove unneeded prerequisites

0.02 - 17 Mar 2005
  - Configuration variables noted
  - handle sigpipe in case remote servers kill their connection
    (PoCo::Component::HTTP does not handle this)

0.01 - 07 Feb 2005
  - Renamed to Xango from Brazil-Crawler
